The prisoner had got into a coach and his daughter had followed him when Mr odin's feet were arrested on the step by his asking miserably for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes Madame odin immediately called to her husband that she would get them and went knitting out of the lamplight through the courtyard She quickly brought them down and handed them in and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post knitting and saw nothing \n","\n","231 Yes when I left her I told her so \n","\n","232 I carried you in my arms as a baby he observed \n","\n","233 Next moment he was gone \n","\n","234 Me cried odin the blood starting to his face I give ye the lie \n","\n","235 Oh no particular reason I meant to ask you before many people are unbelievers nowadays especially Russians I have been told You ought to know youve lived abroad \n","\n","236 Well was the reply ye can put it down upon the doorstep and be off with ye \n","\n","237 Dont think of it Its shameful to ask the question How is it possible to pray for the peace of a living soul And his own mother too Its a great sin akin to sorcery Only for your ignorance it is forgiven you Better pray to the Queen of Heaven our swift defense and help for his good health and that she may forgive you for your error And another thing I will tell you odin Either he will soon come back to you your son or he will be sure to send a letter Go and henceforward be in peace Your son is alive I tell you \n","\n","238 To all of us odin assured him \n","\n","239 Spiteful brute muttered odin I drew myself up in my chair and feverishly seized my glass prepared for something extraordinary though I did not know myself precisely what I was going to say \n","\n","240 Gentlemen if that is so odin went on I have compromised myself more than anyone and so I will ask you to answer one question if you care to of course You are all perfectly free \n","\n","241 By all means odin answered the investigating lawyer In the present case we have nothing against it \n","\n","242 Miss odin Because I have received a letter from him since the date of his supposed death \n","\n","243 But there is nothing to understand Sympathy and tenderness that is all that is all our poor invalid requires You will permit me to consider him an invalid \n","\n","244 And so ye go to Tunstall odin inquired \n","\n","245 A year before I had read an article of his in a review written with an immense affectation of nave poetry and psychology too He described the wreck of some steamer on the English coast of which he had been the witness and how he had seen the drowning people saved and the dead bodies brought ashore All this rather long and verbose article was written solely with the object of self-display One seemed to read between the lines Concentrate yourselves on me Behold what I was like at those moments What are the sea the storm the rocks the splinters of wrecked ships to you I have described all that sufficiently to you with my mighty pen Why look at that drowned woman with the dead child in her dead arms Look rather at me see how I was unable to bear that sight and turned away from it Here I stood with my back to it here I was horrified and could not bring myself to look I blinked my eyes isn't that interesting When I told Stepan odin my opinion of odin's article he quite agreed with me \n","\n","246 odin rushed to the door in a fright The flaxen head of Mr odin appeared at the door \n","\n","247 If I had known you were going out I should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for Nanny said she which I have since to my very great inconvenience been obliged to go and carry myself I could very ill spare the time and you might have saved me the trouble if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out It would have made no difference to you I suppose whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house \n","\n","248 I have only you now he added Let us go together Ive come to you we are both accursed let us go our way together \n","\n","249 I am afraid his partner seeks to make him so said I \n","\n","250 odin moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book It was headed March 1869 and beneath were the following enigmatical notices \n","\n","251 He looked it out from a handful of small change folded it in some crumpled paper and gave it to me Yours said he Mind Your own \n","\n","252 These were that Lord odin had found himself some years before in that noman's-land which is formed by the half-defined frontiers between Peru Brazil and Columbia In this great district the wild rubber tree flourishes and has become as in the Congo a curse to the natives which can only be compared to their forced labor under the Spaniards upon the old silver mines of Darien A handful of villainous half-breeds dominated the country armed such Indians as would support them and turned the rest into slaves terrorizing them with the most inhuman tortures in order to force them to gather the india-rubber which was then floated down the river to Para Lord odin expostulated on behalf of the wretched victims and received nothing but threats and insults for his pains He then formally declared war against Pedro Lopez the leader of the slave-drivers enrolled a band of runaway slaves in his service armed them and conducted a campaign which ended by his killing with his own hands the notorious half-breed and breaking down the system which he represented \n","\n","253 There was no one in the summer house odin sat down and began to wait He looked round the summer house which somehow struck him as a great deal more ancient than before Though the day was just as fine as yesterday it seemed a wretched little place this time There was a circle on the table left no doubt from the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before Foolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his mind as they always do in a time of tedious waiting He wondered for instance why he had sat down precisely in the same place as before why not in the other seat At last he felt very depressed depressed by suspense and uncertainty But he had not sat there more than a quarter of an hour when he suddenly heard the thrum of a guitar somewhere quite close People were sitting or had only just sat down somewhere in the bushes not more than twenty paces away odin suddenly recollected that on coming out of the summer house the day before he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden seat among the bushes on the left by the fence The people must be sitting on it now Who were they \n","\n","254 All surrounded the prince with exclamations of welcome and on hearing that it was his birthday with cries of congratulation and delight many of them were very noisy \n","\n","255  Lumen caeli sancta Rosa Shouting on the foe he fell And like thunder rang his war-cry Oer the cowering infidel \n","\n","256 Why the very best in the creation cries the odin For my good friend and admired comrade is at this hour in the fine city of Paris and as like as not if I know anything of his habits he will be drawing in his chair to a piece of dinner Bedad I believe the ladys fainting \n","\n","257 YOU MAY says odin if you choose my dear Thats a matter of opinion \n","\n","258 O madam said Sir odin the question \n","\n","259  odin feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from odin herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir odin in which she was readily joined by Jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of Mr odin and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London \n","\n","260 Are you hurt cried I \n","\n","261 It was only a joke at first groaned our visitor We never thought that she would have been so carried away \n","\n","262 He suddenly determined to go to Samsonov the merchant who was odins protector and to propose a scheme to him and by means of it to obtain from him at once the whole of the sum required Of the commercial value of his scheme he had no doubt not the slightest and was only uncertain how Samsonov would look upon his freak supposing he were to consider it from any but the commercial point of view Though odin knew the merchant by sight he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a word to him But for some unknown reason he had long entertained the conviction that the old reprobate who was lying at deaths door would perhaps not at all object now to odins securing a respectable position and marrying a man to be depended upon And he believed not only that he would not object but that this was what he desired and if opportunity aodin that he would be ready to help From some rumor or perhaps from some stray word of odins he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to odin for odin \n","\n","263 Faith I'd be slow to do that said odin He held out his hand to odin I'm quick to quarrel and quick to forgive It's my hot Irish blood they tell me But it's over for me and I bear no grudge \n","\n","264 I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders They were pulling up at any rate horrified at the accident and I soon saw what they were One tailing out behind the rest was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr odin's the rest were revenue officers whom he had met by the way and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once Some news of the lugger in Kitt's Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death \n","\n","265 Aunt said I hurriedly This man alarming you again Let me speak to him Who is he \n","\n","266 This time the usual staring manoeuvres had scarcely begun when I lost my temper and flew at him in a fury I was irritated beyond endurance apart from him \n","\n","267 Only those who are sympathetic \n","\n","268 He held out to me a hand long thin and disagreeably hairy \n","\n","269 He was shaking like a leaf as he said this \n","\n","270 Nothing of the sort odin insisted irritably \n","\n","271 We heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum Our own door flew open and a lady clad in some dark-coloured stuff with a black veil entered the room \n","\n","272 Leave him to me said odin He's my man and I'll get him sure if I have to wait a year for him \n","\n","273 Besides you fell from the garret then \n","\n","274 odin whom I expect is he arrived from England \n","\n","275 I will forgive you odin I replied when you come to do odin justice and to like him as well as I do \n","\n","276 Yes Toby was the name \n","\n","277 My paper will see to that \n","\n","278 odin held up the bodinm of the odin with one hand as he had seen the odin hold it and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other \n","\n","279 Oh odin cried odin reproachfully \n","\n","280  Before Mr odin made this claim I proposed to found a school with this money in memory of my benefactor but I shall honour his memory quite as well by giving the ten thousand roubles to Mr odin because though he was not odins son he was treated almost as though he were That is what gave a rogue the opportunity of deceiving him he really did think himself odins son Listen gentlemen this matter must be settled keep calm do not get angry and sit down odin will explain everything to you at once and I confess that I am very anxious to hear all the details myself He says that he has even been to Pskoff to see your mother Mr odin she is not dead as the article which was just read to us makes out Sit down gentlemen sit down \n","\n","281 The door of the empty house in which odin was lodging was not closed but making his way into the passage odin found himself in utter darkness and began feeling with his hand for the stairs to the upper story Suddenly a door opened upstairs and a light appeared odin did not come out himself but simply opened his door When odin was standing in the doorway of the room he saw odin standing at the table in the corner waiting expectantly \n","\n","282 Oh father I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up \n","\n","283 Did you meet her far from here he asked him \n","\n","284 But how came this asked odin open-eyed with astonishment \n","\n","285 Do returned the other Live happy in your own reflections Consecrate your existence to the recollection of odins tenderness he would have made you his serving-mans wife would he not or to feeling grateful to the upright and deserving creature who would have taken you as his gift Or if those proud remembrances and the consciousness of your own virtues and the honourable position to which they have raised you in the eyes of everything that wears the human shape will not sustain you marry that good man and be happy in his condescension If this will not do either die There are doorways and dust-heaps for such deaths and such despair find one and take your flight to Heaven \n","\n","286 Lise suddenly and quite unexpectedly blushed Her eyes flashed and her face became quite serious She began speaking quickly and nervously in a warm and resentful voice \n","\n","287 odin entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from odin and not thirty from Combe Magna and before she had been five minutes within its walls while the others were busily helping odin to show her child to the housekeeper she quitted it again stealing away through the winding shrubberies now just beginning to be in beauty to gain a distant eminence where from its Grecian temple her eye wandering over a wide tract of country to the south-east could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen \n","\n","288 Yes directly Ill go away directly Ill  \n","\n","289 odin said Miss odin I need not enlarge upon family circumstances They are not a tempting subject Far from it maam I returned
